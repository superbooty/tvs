Backbone application file: application.js
This file must be including in the index.html file after all files which support this file are included.  See the follogin structure

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>TV Finder</title>
    <script src="lib/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/underscore.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/handlebars.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/backbone.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/bootstrap.js"></script>
    <script src="templates.js"></script>
    <script src="application.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="styles/tvfinder.css">
</head>

index.html - contains the entry point into the application.  When this file loads it will call the backbone application and do stuff

Here is my take on the structure.

root -> contains the index.htm 
templates -> This directory contains the handlebar templates and potentially the handlebars compiled js code
img -> this is the root for all image files (local assets).  you can further structure that just remember to follow 
the proper path when you want to get at the assets from your html files.
lib -> This directory will house all of the framework(s) or third party javascript files 
js -> This directory houses javascript files that developers create for the application
styles -> This directory houses the stylesheets that will be used by the application.
